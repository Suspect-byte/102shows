## What is this?
102shows is a driver for the APA102 LED strip on a Raspberry Pi and also a collection of lightshows.
These lightshows can be controlled over your home network via MQTT.
And for those who do not prefer sending raw MQTT messages from the console, there is a ([Node-RED](https://nodered.org)-based) web interface.
Its responsive layout makes it ideal for both smartphones, tablets and computers.
