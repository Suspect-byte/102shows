*Raspberry Pi + APA102 + MQTT + 102shows = LED awesomeness!*

|Code Climate|

102shows is an
`APA102 <https://www.aliexpress.com/item//32322326979.html>`__ (a.k.a
`DotStar <https://www.adafruit.com/products/2240>`__) LED strip for the
Raspberry Pi and also a collection of lightshows. These lightshows can
be controlled over your home network via MQTT. And for those who do not
prefer sending raw MQTT messages from the console, there is a
(`Node-RED <https://nodered.org>`__-based) web interface. Its responsive
layout makes it ideal for both smart phones, tablets and computers.
